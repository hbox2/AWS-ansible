1.Create AWS account
2. In the previously created AWS account, you need to create a user. 
I use the region us-east-1 so the link will be like this:

https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/users

Click "Add user" and enter a username. Install checkbox opposite "Programmatic access" - this is necessary to obtain AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.These keys are required to run our playbooks without asking for a username and password.


Then click "Attach existing policices directly" and install checkbox opposite "AmazonEC2FullAccess".Then click "Create user".

You will see Access key ID and Secret access key for your this user. Copy them somewhere they will come in handy.

3. Install ansible (Gentoo: emerge -avq ansible,Debian/Ubuntu: apt install ansible, RedHat/Centos: yum install ansible)

4. At a command prompt, run:
pip install --user boto 
pip install --user boto3
pip install --user botocore
pip install --user ansible 

And check python at a command prompt:
python
import boto
import boto3
import botocore 

5. Trying to connect:
Download ec2.ini from official link :
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/contrib/inventory/ec2.ini

Download ec2.py from official link:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/contrib/inventory/ec2.py
(and chmod +x ec2.py)

Please edit ec2.ini and uncomment this line:
elasticache = False

Create a .aws (dot aws) directory in your user's home directory and create a "credentials" file inside it:
[default]                                                                                     
aws_access_key_id = Your_access_key                                                      aws_secret_access_key = You_secret_access

And try run:
./ec2.py --list 

You should see the output of all running instances, etc.

4.Edit playbook:
To one_playbook.yaml file insert:

---
aws_access_key_id = 'Your_access_key'
aws_secret_access_key = 'You_secret_access'

5. Run our playbook
ansible-playbook one_playbook.yaml
